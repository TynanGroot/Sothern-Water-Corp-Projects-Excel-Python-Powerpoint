Here is everything I did with for the Southern Water Corps Project. 
#Python # Exploratory Data Analysis #Descriptive Statistics #Regression model # Inferential Statistics#Pandas #Matplotlib #Seaborn #Statsmodels #Jupyternotebook #OLS Multivariate Regression Model #Prediction Validation

This project is really three projects which are as follows:

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Files:
Southern Water Corp Financial Case Study.xlsx - The excel file with the data I used to draw insights about KPIs such as revenue over time, costs over time, and EBIT. A 
PARTICULARLY INTERSTING FIND was that costs per water gallon went down as the quantity produced went up.

Financial Presentation Southern Water Corp [Tynan].pptx - The presentation of the key finds regarding Southern water Corps' finances

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Files:
Southern Water Corps Economic Case Study.xlsx - The excel file/data I used to leverage market balancing prices of products across time to make key calculations like the EoD percentage. Other economic analyses were made

Economic Presentation Southern Water Corps [Tynan].pptx - The presentation of my key findings. Made multiple conclusions about the difference in economic elasticity of different water products across different types of clientel.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Files:

1618836907_Statistics_Case_Study_Tynan_27062020v2.xlsx - I used line charts to track the interaction of variables regrading tracked within water plants such as  PUMP FAILURE (1 OR 0), temperature, and Horsepower. I also used inferential stats like linear regression to discover a way to predict pump failure before it happens

Statistics(PF)Presentation_SouthernWaterCorpStatisticsTynan.pptx - The presentations of my findings in the above excel file.

Python Analysis
Files: Southern_Water_Corp_Python_SpringBoard.ipynb

I returned to the Pump Data from the Statistics Analysis for more sophisticated project with Python in order to automate the process for the future use.
Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, pyplot) in Jupyter Notebook
Included both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics
Included box plot, correlation heatmap, bar/line plot, timeframe chart
